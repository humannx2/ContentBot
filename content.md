Core Web Vitals are a set of three metrics that Google uses to measure the user experience of a website.  These metrics are crucial for SEO and overall website performance.  The three Core Web Vitals are:

* **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** This measures the perceived load speed of a page by identifying the time it takes for the largest content element (image, text block, or video) to render within the viewport. A good LCP score is under 2.5 seconds.  Improving LCP often involves optimizing images, using efficient code, and ensuring that the main content is loaded quickly.

* **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):** This measures visual stability by quantifying the amount of unexpected layout shifts that occur during a page load.  A high CLS score indicates that elements are shifting around on the screen, causing a frustrating user experience. A good CLS score is under 0.1.  Improving CLS often involves reserving space for ads and images, avoiding inserting content above existing content, and using consistent image dimensions.

* **First Input Delay (FID):** This measures interactivity by measuring the delay between when a user first interacts with a page (e.g., clicks a button) and when the browser actually responds to that interaction. A good FID score is under 100 milliseconds.  Improving FID often involves optimizing JavaScript execution and minimizing blocking rendering tasks.

By focusing on improving these three Core Web Vitals, website owners can create a significantly better user experience, leading to higher engagement, better SEO rankings, and ultimately more success online.  Addressing these metrics isn't just about technical optimization; it's about ensuring a smooth and enjoyable experience for every visitor.
